# README-Generator

## Description 
Using fs and inquirer, I was able to build a ReadMe generator that uses my questions array to fill out the information to be used in the Readme.md file. 

## Usage Information
To be able to fill out the information, type 'node index.js' and fill in the answers to the questions posed. Once finished, the Readme file will generate.
